      <h2>The Poet's Journey Over Time:
    </h2>
      <ul>
        <li><u>1883</u> - Born.</li>
        <li><u>1904</u> - Gibran held his first art exhibition of his drawings. During this exhibition, Gibran met Mary Haskell, the headmistress of a girls' school in the city, nine years his senior. The two formed a friendship that lasted the rest of Gibran's life. Haskell would spend large sums of money to support Gibran and would also edit all of his English writings. The nature of their romantic relationship remains obscure; while some biographers assert the two were lovers but never married because Haskell's family objected, other evidence suggests that their relationship was never physically consummated. </li>
        <li><u>1917</u> - The Madman, the Pen League, and The Prophet.</li>
        <li><u>1931</u> - Gibran was admitted to St. Vincent's Hospital, Manhattan, on April 10, 1931, where he died the same day, aged 48, after having refused the last rites. The cause of death was reported to be cirrhosis of the liver with incipient tuberculosis in one of his lungs.</li>
      </ul>
